## Important
As of 9/9/2025, [the real website](https://team3100.com/) is not set up to do any of what this repository does. Over time the purpose of this repo should be migrated to the website, and
the repo should be depracted and link to that instead

## Philosofy
Uses github pages to host "evergeen" (**thier names will not change**) files whos content will be updated between years so that we can make QR Codes and send people links that will never become invalid.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This repository is mainly meant for non-technical people. That being said there is code here, it doesnt bite just do look at it the wrong way.
> This README has instructions (maybe the google drive has it documented) on how to maintain this from year to year 


## File purposes
* `current_year_dates.ics` When opened by a browser, most browsers will open your calender and let you put whatever events it has into your calender.
> [!CAUTION]
> This file should not be linked to directly because some QR readers will open an undesierable UI. Instead make qr codes that link to `calender_dates_redirect.html`


## Guides
### Making ICS files
[This website](https://ical.marudot.com/) is great and easy to use for generating ICS files. If you find a better one put it here.
